# J3L+ SMP Stats Explorer

## This is up-to-date as of 1.7.2, but I do want to do a 'documentation' update soon. We'll see.

## By J_dg aka Jaden Unruh

This program runs next to the server jar on the Minecraft server I host, and it provides a web interface that lets players view relevant details about the server - a world map, player stats, advancements, and inventories, etc. I used this as an opportunity to learn more about web development, learn Svelte, and figure out how to better use Spring to host webpages. I've learned oh so much about web development, networking, and project management through this endeavor.

### Web Interface

Home, or `j3lsmp.org`, features a few screenshots from the server, topped by a navigation bar on top and a footer below that will persist across all pages. In the navigation bar, clicking the logo and server name in the top left will always take users back to this page, as will `Home`, the first of the navigational links. The rest of the navigational links will take users to each of the pages as described below.

- Players (`/players`) shows a full list of all players that have been on the server, linking to their Overview page which in turn connects to `Advancements` `Statistics`, and `Inventory` for each player.

- Leaderboards (`/leaderboards`) shows a selection of statistical leaderboards, showing which players have, for example, played the longest or killed the most mobs.

- Ratios (`/ratios`) is similar to Leaderboards, but all lists there are a ratio between two stats. These ones don't necessarily have a 'better' side to be on, and are likely easier for newer players to find themselves at a desired extreme of.

- Items (`/items`) features an overview of item statistics for the whole server, as well as a searchable list of all the items in the game, linking to each items individual page. Therein, item-specific server-wide statistics will be shown, as well as a pie chart for each relevant statistic for that specific item - (e.g., mined for blocks, broken for tools, picked up for all) comparing that statistic for each player.

- Mobs (`/mobs`) is basically the same as Items but for mobs, summarizing kills and deaths on the server and individual statistics on a page for each mob.

- World Map is a scrollable, zoomable, tiled map of each dimension (2 for nether, surface and roof). In the overworld, labels can be toggled in the navbar. I may do labels in other dimensions at some point but this feels less important. These maps are generated by [uNmINeD](https://unmined.net/) manually, I may automate this at some point.

- GitHub links off the webpage, to this GitHub repository.

### API

The server front-end pages pull data from an api (all `/api/*` routings are handled by Spring, rather than Sveltekit). I used to include some documentation for that here, but it's gotten more extensive in recent updates so I will no longer do so. A full list of webpage routings, including the API, is kept relatively current on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xaMvaQsisWhR5-Y_4KLrGMsdJ0rf-DgDMUvJn4TzeQ4/edit?usp=sharing) for the curious souls, but for full documentation read the javadocs.

### The backend and program details

This tool uses a backend programmed in Java using Spring Boot with Maven for build and dependency management, and all front-end pages are handled by Sveltekit. Svelte handles all routing except the API.

API calls to players uses the [Mojang API](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mojang_API) to map player names to UUIDs.
